# StressSpec - Requirements Stress Tester
# Python dependencies for the project
#
# BEGINNER NOTES:
# - This file lists all the external libraries our project needs
# - It's like a shopping list for Python packages
# - pip install -r requirements.txt will install all of these
# - Version numbers (>=7.0.0) ensure we get compatible versions

pytest>=7.0.0      # Testing framework - runs our unit tests
argparse            # Command-line argument parsing (built into Python 3.2+)
pathlib             # Modern file path handling (built into Python 3.4+)
typing-extensions   # Additional type hints for older Python versions
