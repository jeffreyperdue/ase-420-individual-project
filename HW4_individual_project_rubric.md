# HW4 Individual Project Rubric

- Total: **25 points**  
- Each assignment: **5 points**  
- All-or-nothing grading (complete all requirements to earn 5 points)
- **Everyone submits this rubric** (team leaders + team members)

---

## ðŸ“˜ Assignment 1 (5 pts)

**Collect Individual Sprint 1 Metrics**

- [x] Total individual Lines of Code (LoC): **9,154**
- [x] Number of individual features completed: **15+**
- [x] Number of individual requirements completed: **13/13 (100%)**
- [x] Individual burndown rate (%): **100%**

---

**Calculation:**

- Individual burndown rate = (Completed Requirements / Total Requirements) Ã— 100%
- Individual burndown rate = (13 / 13) Ã— 100% = **100%**

**Points:** **5** / 5

## ðŸ“˜ Assignment 2 (5 pts)

Use the answers for your Marp presentation.

**Collect Individual Sprint 1 Retrospective**

### What Went Wrong (Individual Level):
- **Test Infrastructure Issues**: 21 failing tests in the web error handling module due to async test configuration and missing dependencies (pytest-asyncio)
- **Scope Creep**: Originally planned 4 risk detectors but implemented 6, plus added complete web UI which wasn't in original Sprint 1 scope
- **Documentation Lag**: While code was well-documented, user documentation and API docs could have been updated more frequently during development

### What Went Well (Individual Level):
- **Excellent Architecture**: Successfully implemented SOLID principles with Factory, Strategy, and Template Method patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 42 passing tests covering core functionality with good test coverage for CLI components
- **Rapid MVP Delivery**: Completed full end-to-end workflow in Week 2, exceeding timeline expectations
- **Web UI Excellence**: Delivered production-ready FastAPI web application with modern UI, responsive design, and comprehensive features
- **Quality Code**: 9,154 lines of well-structured, documented Python code following best practices

### Analysis & Improvement Plan (Individual Level):
- **Fix Test Infrastructure**: Install pytest-asyncio and resolve async test issues to achieve 100% test pass rate
- **Scope Management**: Better upfront planning to avoid feature creep, though the additional features were valuable
- **Continuous Documentation**: Implement documentation-as-code approach with automated updates during development
- **Performance Testing**: Add load testing for web application to ensure scalability under concurrent users

**Points:** **5** / 5

Make a summary of your individual progress in the Sprint 1

- **Week 1**: Project setup, architecture design, and initial CLI foundation. Established SOLID principles and design patterns. Created basic project structure with file loader and requirement parser modules.
- **Week 2**: **MVP COMPLETE** - Delivered full end-to-end workflow with 800+ lines of code, 27 passing tests, and comprehensive CLI interface. Exceeded timeline by completing core functionality ahead of schedule.
- **Week 3**: Enhanced risk detection with 6 detector modules, implemented multi-format reporting (Markdown, CSV, JSON), and added configurable rules system. Total of 31 passing tests with robust architecture.
- **Week 4**: **WEB UI COMPLETE** - Delivered production-ready FastAPI web application with modern UI, responsive design, file upload system, real-time analysis, and comprehensive API. Final codebase: 9,154 lines across 48 Python files.
