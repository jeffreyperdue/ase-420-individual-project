## üìò Assignment 1 (5 pts)

**Collect Individual Sprint 1 Metrics**

- [x] Total individual Lines of Code (LoC): **~9,150**
- [x] Number of individual features completed: **6**
- [x] Number of individual requirements completed: **7/7 (100%)**
- [x] Individual burndown rate (%): **100%**

---

**Calculation:**

- Individual burndown rate = (Completed Requirements / Total Requirements) √ó 100%
- Individual burndown rate = (7 / 7) √ó 100% = **100%**
