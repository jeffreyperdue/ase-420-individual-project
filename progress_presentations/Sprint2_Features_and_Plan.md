# Sprint 2 Plan & Requirements
## StressSpec Requirements Stress Tester

## Sprint 2 Features 

### **Feature #1: Complete Test Coverage**
**Goal:** Achieve 100% test pass rate by fixing remaining 4 integration test failures.

**Why Essential:** Foundation for all future development - can't build on broken tests.

**Implementation:**
- Fix the 4 remaining integration test failures
- Ensure all 63+ tests pass consistently
- Add any missing test coverage for critical paths

---

### **Feature #2: Complete 8-Category Risk Detection**
**Goal:** Add the 3 missing risk detection modules (Privacy, Traceability, Scope) to complete the original 8-category plan.

**Why Essential:** This was the core promise of the original project plan.

**Implementation:**
- **Privacy Detector** (3 hours): Basic GDPR/CCPA compliance checks
- **Traceability Detector** (3 hours): Requirement ID validation and linking
- **Scope Detector** (2-4 hours): Basic scope creep detection

**Simplified Approach:**
- Use existing detector pattern (copy and modify existing detectors)
- Start with basic keyword-based detection (no complex ML/AI)
- Focus on most common risk patterns only

---

### **Feature #3: Basic HTML Reports**
**Goal:** Add simple HTML report generation with basic styling.

**Why Essential:** Makes the tool more user-friendly for stakeholders.

**Implementation:**
- Create simple HTML template using existing Jinja2 setup
- Basic Bootstrap styling (copy from existing web UI)
- Include summary statistics and risk breakdown
- No complex charts initially - just tables and basic formatting

---

### **Feature #4: Enhanced Severity Scoring** 
**Goal:** Implement "Top 5 Riskiest Requirements" feature.

**Why Essential:** Provides immediate value to users for prioritization.

**Implementation:**
- Calculate combined risk scores per requirement
- Sort and display top 5 riskiest
- Add to existing report formats (Markdown, CSV, JSON, HTML)

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint 2 Epic Overview

**Total Stories:** 6 user stories across 4 epics   
**Scope:** Complete 8-category risk detection + enhanced reporting + advanced scoring  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Epic 1: Complete Test Coverage

### **Story 1.1: Fix Integration Test Failures**
**As a** developer  
**I want** all integration tests to pass with 100% success rate  
**So that** I can have confidence in the system's reliability and maintainability  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 63+ tests pass consistently
- Integration tests cover web API endpoints properly
- Error handling tests validate correct exception responses
- Logging tests handle Windows file permission issues gracefully
  
**Priority:** Critical (foundation for all other work)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Epic 2: Complete 8-Category Risk Detection

### **Story 2.1: Privacy Risk Detection**
**As a** compliance officer  
**I want** to detect privacy-related risks in requirements  
**So that** I can ensure GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations are properly addressed  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detects requirements mentioning data collection without privacy policy references
- Flags personal data handling without consent mechanisms
- Identifies data storage without protection requirements
- Uses keyword-based detection (simple, reliable approach)

**Priority:** High (completes original 8-category plan)

### **Story 2.2: Traceability Risk Detection**
**As a** QA engineer  
**I want** to identify traceability gaps in requirements  
**So that** I can ensure all requirements can be properly tracked and tested  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detects requirements without clear unique identifiers
- Flags requirements without test coverage references
- Identifies missing acceptance criteria
- Validates requirement linking and dependencies

**Priority:** High (completes original 8-category plan)

### **Story 2.3: Scope Risk Detection**
**As a** project manager  
**I want** to identify scope creep and boundary violations  
**So that** I can maintain project scope and prevent feature bloat  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detects requirements outside defined project boundaries
- Flags ambiguous feature scope definitions
- Identifies conflicting scope statements
- Validates requirement priority alignment

**Priority:** High (completes original 8-category plan)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Epic 3: Advanced Scoring & Analytics

### **Story 3.1: Top 5 Riskiest Requirements**
**As a** team lead  
**I want** to see the top 5 most risky requirements  
**So that** I can prioritize team efforts on the highest-impact issues first  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Calculates combined risk score for each requirement
- Ranks and displays top 5 riskiest requirements
- Shows detailed risk breakdown for each requirement
- Integrates with existing report formats (Markdown, CSV, JSON)

**Priority:** Medium (valuable enhancement)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Epic 4: Enhanced Reporting

### **Story 4.1: Standalone HTML Report Generation**
**As a** stakeholder  
**I want** to generate professional HTML reports that can be saved and shared independently  
**So that** I can create formal documentation for meetings and presentations  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generates complete HTML files with embedded CSS
- Professional styling suitable for executive presentations
- Self-contained reports (no web server required)
- Includes executive summary, risk breakdown, and top 5 riskiest requirements
- Compatible with existing web UI (adds new export option)
 
**Priority:** Medium (enhances existing reporting)
