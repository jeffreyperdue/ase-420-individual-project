A Python-based tool for analyzing requirement documents and detecting
potential risks and issues before development begins.

BEGINNER NOTES:
- This file makes the 'src' directory a Python package
- It's like a "welcome sign" that tells Python "this folder contains code"
- The __version__ and __author__ variables can be imported by other modules
- This is a common Python convention for package metadata

__version__ = "0.1.0"      # Current version of the software
