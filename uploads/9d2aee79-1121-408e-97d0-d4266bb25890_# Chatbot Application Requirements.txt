# Chatbot Application Requirements

## Epic Requirement
As a **user**,  
I want to communicate with a chatbot through text,  
so that I can ask questions or get help automatically.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Input
As a **user**,  
I want to type questions or messages into a chat window,  
so that I can communicate naturally with the chatbot.

### 2. Response Generation
As a **user**,  
I want the chatbot to reply to my messages with relevant answers,  
so that I can get useful information or support.

### 3. Conversation Context
As a **user**,  
I want the chatbot to remember the last few messages in a conversation,  
so that its responses make sense in context.

### 4. Error Handling
As a **user**,  
I want the chatbot to handle unclear or incomplete questions gracefully,  
so that I receive a helpful clarification instead of an error.

### 5. Predefined Topics
As a **developer**,  
I want to define common question–answer pairs (like FAQs),  
so that the chatbot can respond quickly to frequent requests.

### 6. Fallback Responses
As a **user**,  
I want the chatbot to give a polite fallback message when it doesn’t know the answer,  
so that the conversation still feels natural.

### 7. Logging
As a **system administrator**,  
I want the chatbot to log conversations,  
so that I can review interactions for quality or improvement.

### 8. Multi-Platform Support
As a **user**,  
I want to access the chatbot through both a web interface and a messaging app,  
so that I can use it wherever is most convenient.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability** – The interface should be simple, with a clear text input box and visible chat history.  
2. **Performance** – The chatbot should respond within two seconds for most requests.  
3. **Reliability** – The system should handle at least 100 concurrent users without failure.  
4. **Scalability** – It should be easy to add new predefined questions or integrate a new NLP model later.  
5. **Security** – User messages should not be shared with unauthorized third parties.  
6. **Availability** – The chatbot should be available 99% of the time.  
7. **Maintainability** – Code should be modular, allowing new features or responses to be added easily.
