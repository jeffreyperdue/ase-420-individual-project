"""
Test package for StressSpec.

BEGINNER NOTES:
- This file makes the 'tests' directory a Python package
- It's mostly empty because we don't need to import anything special
- Having this file allows pytest to discover and run our test files
- It's like a "test area" sign that tells Python "this folder contains tests"
